# DataVisify

## Overview

**DataVisify** is a web application that allows users to upload CSV files and generate interactive graphs and visualizations based on the data. It leverages Plotly.js for creating a variety of chart types to help users analyze their data efficiently.

![DataVisify Interface](https://example.com/image.png)

The image shows the interface of a data visualization platform called DataVisify. The interface allows users to upload CSV files for data analysis. The "Data Preview" section displays the first five rows of a dataset, which appears to be related to Titanic passengers, including columns for passenger ID, survival status, class, name, sex, age, siblings/spouses aboard, parents/children aboard, ticket number, fare, cabin, and embarkation port. Below the data preview, there is a line chart visualizing the relationship between the number of parents/children aboard (Parch) on the x-axis and age on the y-axis. The chart shows a distribution of ages across different values of Parch, with green bars representing age data points.
